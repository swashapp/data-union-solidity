/**
 * @title Ownable
 * @dev The Ownable contract has an owner address, and provides basic authorization control
 * functions, this simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".
 *
 * Open Zeppelin's ownable doesn't quite work with factory pattern because _owner has private access.
 * When you create a DU, open-zeppelin _owner would be 0x0 (no state from template). Then no address could change _owner to the DU owner.
 * With this custom Ownable, the first person to call initialiaze() can set owner.
